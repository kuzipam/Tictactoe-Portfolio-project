# Tic Tac Toe Portfolio 2 Project

# 1. Changes Made
- Created a Player class that allows players to choose their own marks and enter their names.
- In Portfolio 1, the game loop and functions were hardcoded to only work with X and O. This version removes that restriction.
- Overloaded the check_winner() function to work with the new Player class by referencing player instances.
- Included input validation for all user inputs using fail, clear, and ignore to prevent crashes or invalid states.

# 2. Accomplishments
- The Player class is now the parent class for the two archetypes:  
  - Alchemist(can swap two marks per turn)  
  - Paladin (can move a mark to an adjacent cell)

- Declared useAbility() as a virtual function in the Player class so each subclass can define its own version.
- Implemented swap() in both subclasses for mark manipulation.
-Made an adjacent() helper function used in the Paladin class to check valid adjacent moves.

- The main game loop for regular Tic Tac Toe now allows:
  - Custom player names
  - Custom marks
  - And Dynamic switching between players using a current_player pointer.
  
- For Battle Tic Tac Toe I implemented:
  - Two Player* pointers initialized to nullptr.
  - A Dynamic instantiation of each playerâ€™s chosen archetype (`Alchemist` or `Paladin`) at runtime.
  - Included input validation for class selection, marks, names, and move inputs.
  - A restart option at the end of each game round.
